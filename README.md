During my internship at FSSoftware, a section of the project that my employer gave me as a result of talking and agreeing with the customer.
Briefly, the aim of my project is;
If the FSRDate value is null in the table read, it means that a new item has arrived in this table.
Posting this value to the relevant server and synchronizing the time it was posted to FSRDate.
You can get the required database by running the BaranMasterDataDbScript file :)
